Disk Scheduling Algorithms Documentation

Implement the C-LOOK, C-SCAN, FCFS, LOOK, SCAN and SSTF disk scheduling algorithms on a data structure representation of a disk drive with 5000 cylinders.

Each algorithm should process the given list of 50 disk track numbers and initial head position, then find the total number of seek operations to access the tracks.

The disk track is: 4078, 153, 2819, 3294, 1433, 211, 1594, 2004, 2335, 2007, 771, 1043, 3950, 2784, 1881, 2931, 3599, 1245, 4086, 520, 3901, 2866, 947, 3794, 2353, 3970, 3948, 1815, 4621, 372, 2684, 3088, 827, 3126, 2083, 584, 4420, 1294, 917, 2881, 3659, 2868, 100, 1581, 4581, 1664, 1001, 1213, 3439, 4706
